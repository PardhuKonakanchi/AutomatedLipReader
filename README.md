# AutomatedLipReader

#This project hoped to utilize a Convolutional LSTM model to analyze phenomes through visual analysis of lip movement. Overall the dataset was too small and caused severe overfitting on the training data which led to large discrepancies on the testing data. A much larger and more standardized dataset would be needed to make progress on the issue
