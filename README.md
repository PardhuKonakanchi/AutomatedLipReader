# AutomatedLipReader

#This project was completed last year by me and 2 peers and being uploaded now for viewing purposes. The project hoped to utilize a Convolutional Neural Network-LSTM model to analyze phenomes through visual analysis of lip movement. Overall our test results were quite strong with a testing accuracy of 85.3% on classifying phonemes, consistent with cross-validation of 86.0% and showing no obvious signs of underfitting or overfitting. However, a much larger and standardized model will be needed to allow the model to more accurately classify phonemes during actual speech within words since transitional phonemes were not accounted for .

# Data Collection

#The dataset consisted of video segments of me speaking all English phenomes which in total consisted of 30 classifications including a "space". I would usually speak for about 20 seconds into a camcorder with 30fps and these segments were split into each total phenome loop. The dataset is not uploaded here due to privacy issues.

# Data Preprocessing

#The preprocessing of the data went through several stages and was the primarly bulk of the project writing. Initially the videos were just converted to images and properly split to be sent to the model. After realizing this including unnecessary resources the model is training on, we decided to run the program through facial segmentation to exclude the background. Furthermore we decided to use lip segmentation which increased accuracy on average 5%. However, the preprocessing through lip segmentation was computationally expensive, taking hours to process through all the videos. While lip segmentation is more accurate, for the goal of immediate lip reading in real life scenarios, facial recognition provides a better compromise without sacrificing too much accuracy. To utilize the LSTM we also batched the phonemes in 20 frame segments to capture the average time of lip movement.

# Training Model

#We wanted convolutional neural networks to have accurate image recognition but due to low initial accuracy decided to implement primarily LSTMs. This was because they could use previous frame memory and recognize overall movement of the lip to determine phoneme classification much more accuractely than single frame image analysis. You can find the specific construction and parameters of our model in our model file. We implemented the "Adam" optimizer and "categorical cross entropy" for our loss function.

# Files

#VisualizeLip is a combination of VideoToImageConverter and mouthV3 in order to easily convert videos in the dataset to input data consisting of the pictures of lip segments

#CNN_LSTM codes our training model

#The model available can still be easily used to analyze videos for other purposes by removing facial or lip segmenting processing.
